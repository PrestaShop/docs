# Preliminary tasks

Before you can start your build, you must make sure that the project is ready to be built.

## 1. Create the new version in Addons Marketplace and update native module compatibility

{{% notice warning %}}
**This step requires special rights.**

Ask a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with administrative rights on the Addons Marketplace to perform this step.

{{% notice note %}}
**This only needs to be done once per release.**

_(i.e. if done for a beta, it doesn't need to be performed again for the final release)._

## 2. Make sure the version number has been updated in the Core

{{% notice note %}}
**This only needs to be done once per release.**

PrestaShop does not support pre-release versioning yet. Any build of 1.7.6.0 will be identified as 1.7.6.0 regardless if the release is alpha, beta, RC or stable.

Check the following files and update them if necessary:

* `/install-dev/install_version.php`:

    ```php
    // update the version number below
    define('_PS_INSTALL_VERSION_', '1.7.6.2');
    ```

* `/app/AppKernel.php`:

    ```php
    // Update the version number and version components (const *VERSION and the other one, which depends for patch or minor)
    const VERSION = '1.7.6.2';
    const MAJOR_VERSION_STRING = '1.7';
    const MAJOR_VERSION = 17;
    const MINOR_VERSION = 6;
    const RELEASE_VERSION = 2;
    ```

Make a pull request and have it merged.

## 3. Make sure the default translation catalogue has been updated and pushed to Crowdin

**This step is only needed for minor and major releases.**

It is usually only done once per release as well.
