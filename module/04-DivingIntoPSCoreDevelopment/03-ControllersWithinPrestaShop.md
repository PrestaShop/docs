Controllers within PrestaShop
=============================

In an MVC architecture, a Controller manages the synchronization events
between the View and the Model, and keeps them up to date. It receives
all the user events and triggers the actions to perform.

If an action needs data to be changed, the Controller will "ask" the
Model to change the data, and in turn the Model will notify the View
that the data has been changed, so that the View can update itself.

All of PrestaShop's controllers actually override the Controller class
through another inheriting class:

-   `AdminController`,
-   `ModuleAdminController`,
-   `FrontController`,
-   `ModuleFrontController`.

They can be found in the /classes/controller folder.

The FrontController class
-------------------------

Here are some of the class' properties:

  ----------------------------------
  Property        Description
  --------------- ------------------
  \$template      Template name for
                  page content.

  \$css\_files    Array list of CSS
                  files.

  \$js\_files     Array list of
                  JavaScript files.

  \$errors        Array of errors
                  that have
                  occurred.

  \$guestAllowed  Whether a customer
                  who has signed out
                  can access the
                  page.

  \$initialized   Whether the
                  `init()` function
                  has been called.

  \$iso           The ISO code of
                  the currently
                  selected language.

  \$n             The number of
                  items per page.

  \$orderBy       The field used to
                  sort.

  \$orderWay      Whether to sort is
                  ascending or
                  descending ("ASC"
                  or "DESC").

  \$p             The current page
                  number.

  \$ajax          If the ajax
                  parameter is
                  detected in
                  request, set this
                  flag to true.
  ----------------------------------

### Execution order of the controller's functions

1.  `__contruct()`: Sets all the controller's member variables.
2.  `init()`: Initializes the controller.
3.  `setMedia()` or `setMobileMedia()`: Adds all JavaScript and CSS
    specifics to the page so that they can be combined, compressed and
    cached (see PrestaShop's CCC tool, in the back office "Performance"
    page, under \# the "Advanced preferences" menu).
4.  `postProcess()`: Handles `ajaxProcess`.
5.  `initHeader()`: Called before `initContent()`.
6.  `initContent()`: Initializes the content.
7.  `initFooter()`: Called after `initContent()`.
8.  `display()` or `displayAjax()`: Displays the content.

  ---------------------------------------------

Overriding a controller
-----------------------

Thanks to object inheritance, you can change a controller's behaviors,
or add new ones.

### Keep overrides for your own shop

Overrides in PrestaShop are exclusive. This means that if your module
overrides one of PrestaShop's behaviors, another module will not be able
to use that behavior properly, or override it in an predictable way.

Therefore, overrides should only be used for your own local modules,
when you have a specific need that cannot be applied with it.

It is not recommended to use an override in a module that you intend to
distribute (for instance through the PrestaShop Addons marketplace), and
they are forbidden in partner modules.

### How to

PrestaShop's controllers are all stored in the `/controllers` folder,
and use the "Core" suffix.

For instance, when working with the Category controller:

-   File: `/controllers/CategoryController.php`
-   Class: `CategoryControllerCore`

In order to override a controller, you must first create a new class
without the "Core" suffix, and place its file in the
`/override/controllers` folder.

For instance, when overriding the Category controller:

-   File: `/override/controllers/front/CategoryController.php`
-   Class: `CategoryController`
