Managing Cookies
****************

PrestaShop uses encrypted cookies to store all the session information,
for visitors/clients as well as for employees/administrators.

The Cookie class (``/classes/Cookie.php``) is used to read and write
cookies.

In order to access the cookies from within PrestaShop code, you can use
this:

::

    $this->context->cookie;

All the information stored within a cookie is available using this code:

::

    $this->context->cookie->variable;

::

    If you need to access the PrestaShop cookie from non-PrestaShop code, you can use this code:
    include_once('path_to_prestashop/config/config.inc.php');
    include_once('path_to_prestashop/config/settings.inc.php');
    include_once('path_to_prestashop/classes/Cookie.php');
    $cookie = new Cookie('ps'); // Use "psAdmin" to read an employee's cookie.
