Migrating from 1.6
==================

BACKWARD COMPAT' BROKEN:

-   Payment module have change, check doc.

ENSURE:

-   We changed all variables passed to smarty, make sure what you use is
    still assigned
-   \$link is deprecated (even if it's still passed to smarty, it will
    be removed at some point), use {url} helper
-   make sure your use the new way of calling
    templates: fetch(module:modulename/views/template.tpl)
-   make sure you dont add your assets with hardcoded path in
    displayHeader hook (no change but it's bad)
-   Smarty is automatically escaped, so: 1. Remove all
    |escape:'html':'UTF-8' (FOR FRONT TEMPLATES ONLY) 2. Add nofilter if
    you print html
-   Only rely documented variables ! Any other variable my come from a
    module or just be a left over and might be removed at any time.
-   If you use the backward\_compatiblity package, check that PrestaShop
    version is 1.4 before importing it. With PrestaShop 1.7 you'll get a
    fatal error

Note: many external libraries have been updated. Here is a list of some
external extra doc about it:

How to make a module compatible with 1.6 AND 1.7

-   Use legacy translation system (\$this-&gt;l)
-   Use 2 templates different depending on the version
-   Implements getWidgetVariables and renderWidget but dont explicitly
    implements the php interface.
-   Create all specific hook method like hookDisplayHeader and call
    renderWidget with the correct parameters
