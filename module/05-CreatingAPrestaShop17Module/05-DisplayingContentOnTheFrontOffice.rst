Displaying content on the front office
**************************************

As it is, the module does not do much. In order to display something on
the front office, we have to add support for a few hooks. This is done
by implementing the hooks' methods, and that was actually done in the
``install()`` method we wrote earlier, using the ``registerHook()``
method:

::

    public function install()
    {
      if (Shop::isFeatureActive())
        Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL);
     
      return parent::install() &&
        $this->registerHook('leftColumn') &&
        $this->registerHook('header') &&
        Configuration::updateValue('MYMODULE_NAME', 'my friend');
    }

As you can see, we make it so that the module is hooked to the
"``leftColumn``" and "``header``" hooks. In addition to this, we will
add code for the "``rightColumn``" hook.

Attaching code to a hook requires a specific method for each:

-  ``hookDisplayLeftColumn()``: will hook code into the left column â€“ in
   our case, it will fetch the MYMODULE\_NAME module setting and display
   the module's template file, ``mymodule.tpl``, which must be located
   in the ``/views/templates/hook/`` folder.
-  ``hookDisplayRightColumn()``: will simply do the same as
   ``hookDisplayLeftColumn()``, but for the right column.
-  ``hookDisplayHeader()``: will add a link to the module's CSS file,
   ``/css/mymodule.css``.

::

    public function hookDisplayLeftColumn($params)
    {
      $this->context->smarty->assign(
          array(
              'my_module_name' => Configuration::get('MYMODULE_NAME'),
              'my_module_link' => $this->context->link->getModuleLink('mymodule', 'display')
          )
      );
      return $this->display(__FILE__, 'mymodule.tpl');
    }
       
    public function hookDisplayRightColumn($params)
    {
      return $this->hookDisplayLeftColumn($params);
    }
       
    public function hookDisplayHeader()
    {
      $this->context->controller->addCSS($this->_path.'css/mymodule.css', 'all');
    }  

We are using the Context (``$this->context``) to change a Smarty
variable: Smarty's ``assign()`` method makes it possible for us to set
the template's name variable with the value of the ``MYMODULE_NAME``
setting stored in the configuration database table.

The header hook is not part of the visual header, but enables us to put
code in the ``<head>`` tag of the generated HTML file. This is very
useful for JavaScript or CSS files. To add a link to our CSS file in the
page's ``<head>`` tag, we use the ``addCSS()`` method, which generates
the correct ``<link>`` tag to the CSS file indicated in parameters.

Save your file, and already you can hook your module's template into the
theme, move it around and transplant it (even though there is not
template file for the moment): go to the "Positions" page from the
"Modules" menu in the back office, then click on the "Transplant a
module" button (top right of the page).

In the transplantation form:

-  Find "My module" in the "Module" drop-down list.
-  Choose "(displayLeftColumn) Left column blocks" in the "Hook into"
   drop-down list.
-  Click "Save".

It is useless to try to attach a module to a hook for which it has no
implemented method.

The "Positions" page should reload, with the following message: "Module
transplanted successfully to hook" (or maybe "This module has already
been transplanted to this hook. "). Congratulations! Scroll down the
"Positions" page, and you should indeed see your module among the other
modules in the "Left column blocks" list. Move it to the top of the list
by drag'n'dropping the module's row.

The module is now attached to the left column... but without any
template to display, it falls short of doing anything useful: if you
reload the homepage, the left column simply displays a message where the
module should be, saying "No template found for module mymodule".

Displaying content
==================

Now that we have access to the left column, we should display something
there for the customer to see.

The visible part of the module is defined in .\ ``tpl`` files placed in
specific View folders:

-  ``/views/templates/front/``: front office features.
-  ``/views/templates/admin/``: back office features.
-  ``/views/templates/hook/``: features hooked to a PrestaShop (so can
   be displayed either on the front office or the back office).

Template files can have just about any name. It there is only one such
file, it is good practice to give it the same name as the folder and
main file: ``mymodule.tpl``.

In the case of this tutorial, the module will be hooked to the left
column. Therefore, the TPL files that are called from the column's hook
should be placed in ``/views/templates/hook/`` in order to work
properly.

As said earlier, the content to be displayed in the theme should be
stored in ``.tpl`` template files placed in a specific folder:
``/views/templates/front/``. Template files can have just about any
name. It there is only one such file, it is good practice to give it the
same name as the folder and main file: ``mymodule.tpl``.

We will create the ``mymodule.tpl`` file, which was passed as a
parameter of the ``display()`` method in our module's code, in the
``hookDisplayHome()`` method. When calling a template from within a
hook, PrestaShop looks for that template file in the
``/views/templates/hook/`` folder (in the module's folder), which you
must create yourself.

In PrestaShop 1.4, the module's template files were to be placed at the
root of the module's folder.

For compatibility reasons, template files can still reside in the root
folder in PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6, although the sub-folders of
``/views/templates/`` are now the recommended locations. If you intend
your module to also work in PrestaShop 1.4, you should keep your files
at the root.

Here is our template file, located at
``/views/templates/hook/mymodule.tpl``:

::

    <!-- Block mymodule -->
    <div id="mymodule_block_home" class="block">
      <h4>Welcome!</h4>
      <div class="block_content">
        <p>Hello,
           {if isset($my_module_name) && $my_module_name}
               {$my_module_name}
           {else}
               World
           {/if}
           !       
        </p>   
        <ul>
          <li><a href="{$my_module_link}" title="Click this link">Click me!</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- /Block mymodule -->

This is just regular HTML code... except for a few Smarty calls:

-  The ``{l s='xxx' mod='yyy'}`` call is PrestaShop-specific method that
   enables you to register the string in the module's translation panel.
   The s parameter is the string, while the ``mod`` parameter must
   contain the module's identifier (in the present case, "mymodule"). We
   only use this method once here for readability reasons, but in
   practice it should be used on all of the template's strings.
-  The ``{if}``, ``{else}`` and ``{/if}`` statements are Smarty
   conditionals. In our example, we check that the ``$my_module_name``
   Smarty variable exists (using PHP's ``isset()`` function, which
   considered as trusted by Smarty) and that it is not empty. If it goes
   well, we display the content of that variable; if not, we display
   "World", in order to have "Hello World".
-  The ``{$my_module_link}`` variable in the link's ``href`` attribute:
   this is a Smarty variable that we will create later on, which will
   point to PrestaShop's root directory.

In addition to that, we are going to create a CSS file, and save it as
/css/mymodule.css in the module's folder (or any sub-folder you like to
keep you CSS in):

::

    div#mymodule_block_home p {
      font-size: 150%;
      font-style:italic;
    }

Save the template file in the module's ``/views/templates/hook/`` folder
and the CSS file in the module's ``/css/`` folder, reload your shop's
homepage: the content of the template should appear on top of the left
column, right below the shop's logo (if you have indeed moved it at the
top of the "Left Column" hook during the transplanting part).

As you can see, the theme applies its own CSS to the template we added:

-  Our ``<h4>`` title becomes the block's header, styled the same way as
   the other block titles.
-  Our ``<div class="block_content">`` block has the same style as the
   other blocks on the page.

It is not pretty, but it works the way we want it to.

Disabling the cache
-------------------

If you've followed this tutorial to the letter and still do not see
anything appearing in the theme's left column, it might be because
PrestaShop has cached the previous templates, and is still serving these
to you. Hence, you see the original version of the theme, without your
changes.

Smarty caches a compiled version of the homepage, for performance
reasons. This is immensely helpful for production sites, but is useless
for tests sites, where you may load the front-page very regularly in
order to see the impact of your changes.

When editing or debugging a theme on a test site, you should always
disable the cache, in order to force Smarty to recompile templates on
every page load. To that end, go to the "Advanced Parameters" menu,
select the "Performance" page, then, in the "Smarty" section:

-  Template cache. Choose "Disable the cache".
-  Cache. Disable it.
-  Debug console. You can also open the console if you want to learn
   more about Smarty's internals.

Do NOT disable the cache or enable the debug console on a production
site, as it severely slows everything down! You should always perform
all your tests in a test site, ideally on your own computer rather than
online.

Embedding a template in the theme
=================================

The link that the module displays does not lead anywhere for now. Let's
create the ``display.php`` file that it targets, with a minimal content,
and put it in the module's root folder.

::

    Welcome to this page!

Click the "Click me!" link: the resulting page is just that raw text,
without anything from the theme. We would like to have this text
embedded in the theme, so let's see how to do just that.

As you would expect, we have to create a template file in order to use
the theme's style. Let's create the ``display.tpl`` file, which will
contain the basic "Welcome to my shop!" line, and will be called by
``display.php``. That display.php file will be rewritten into a
front-end controller in order to properly embed our basic template
within the theme's header, footer, columns, etc.

NOTE: You should strive to use explicit and recognizable names for your
template files, so that you can find them quickly in the back office â€“
which is a must when using the translation tool.

Here are our two files:

::

    display.php
    <?php
    class mymoduledisplayModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController
    {
      public function initContent()
      {
        parent::initContent();
        $this->setTemplate('display.tpl');
      }
    }

::

    display.tpl
    Welcome to my shop!

Let's explore ``display.php``, our first PrestaShop front-end
controller, stored in the /controllers/front folder of the module's main
folder:

::

    A front-end controller must be a class that extends the ModuleFrontController class.
    That controller must have one method: `initContent()`, which calls the parent class' `initContent()` method...
    ...which then calls the `setTemplate()` method with our `display.tpl` file.

``setTemplate()`` is the method that will take care of embedding our
one-line template into a full-blown page, with proper header, footer and
sidebars.

Until PrestaShop 1.4, developers who wanted to embed a template file
into the site's theme had to use PHP's include() calls to include each
portion of the page. Here is the equivalent code for display.php:

::

    display.php
    <?php
    // This file must be placed at the root of the module's folder.
    global $smarty;
    include('../../config/config.inc.php');
    include('../../header.php');
     
    $smarty->display(dirname(__FILE__).'/display.tpl');
     
    include('../../footer.php');
    ?>

As you can see, this is not necessary anymore since PrestaShop 1.5: you
can and should use a front-end controller, and both the controller
(Controller) and its template (View) should share the same name:
``display.php`` is tied to ``display.tpl``.

Save both files in their respective folders, and reload your shop's
homepage, then click on the "Click me!", and voilÃ  ! You have your link.
With just a few lines, the end result is already much better, with the
"Welcome" line neatly placed between header, footer and columns!

It is only a first step, but this gives you an idea of what is possible
if you follow the templating rules. Using Smarty

Smarty is a PHP template engine, and is used by PrestaShop's theming
system. It is a free and open-source projet, hosted at
http://www.smarty.net/.

It parses template ``.tpl`` files, looking for dynamic elements to
replace with their contextual equivalents, then send the generated
result to the browser. Those dynamic elements are indicated with curly
brackets: ``{ ... }``. Programmers can create new variables and use them
in TPL files; PrestaShop adds its own set of variables.

For instance, we can create the $my\_module\_message variable in PHP
right in the ``hookDisplayLeftColumn()`` method, and have it displayed
by our template file:

::

    mymodule.php
    public function hookDisplayLeftColumn($params)
    {
        $this->context->smarty->assign(
            array(
                'my_module_name' => Configuration::get('MYMODULE_NAME'),
                'my_module_link' => $this->context->link->getModuleLink('mymodule', 'display'),
                'my_module_message' => $this->l('This is a simple text message') // Do not forget to enclose your strings in the l() translation method
            )
        );
         
        return $this->display(__FILE__, 'mymodule.tpl');
    }

From there on, we can ask Smarty to display the content of this variable
in our TPL file.

::

    mymodule.tpl
    {$my_module_message}

PrestaShop adds its own set of variables. For instance,
``{$hook_left_column}`` will be replaced with the content for the left
column, meaning the content from all the modules that have been attached
to the left column's hook.

All Smarty variables are global. You should therefore pay attention not
to name your own variable with the name of an existing Smarty variable,
in order to avoid overwriting it. It is good practice to avoid overly
simple names, such as ``{products}``, and to prefix it with your
module's name, or even your own name or initials, such as:
``{$henryb_mymodule_products}``.

Here is a list of Smarty variables that are common to all pages:

There are many other contextual hooks. If you need to display all of the
current page's Smarty variables, add the following call:

::

    {debug}

Comments are based on asterisk:

::

    {* This string is commented out *}
     
    {*
    This string is too!
    *}

Unlike with HTML comments, commented-out Smarty code is not present in
the final output file.
