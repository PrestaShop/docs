# How to migrate Back Office pages to Symfony horizontally

_Pick up a legacy page in Back Office, refactor code targeting only one layer to follow Symfony framework standards (depending on stage of migration it may be the `controller`, `view`, `form` or a `CQRS` layer). When one layer is migrated in all the pages, then the related legacy code can be deleted_.
