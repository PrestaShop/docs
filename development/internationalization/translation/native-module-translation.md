In PrestaShop lingo, "native modules" refers to all the modules that are bundled and distributed with the Core. 

In difference with 3rd party modules, native modules' translation catalogues are distributed with the Core itself. Thanks to this, Native modules are translated using the [New translation system][new-system] introduced in PrestaShop 1.7.
