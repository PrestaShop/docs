# Selling your modules on the Addons Marketplace

Have you already developed modules or themes for your customers? Are you looking for a new revenue stream? You can sell your modules on the Addons Marketplace.
 
Learn all about it in the Addons site: [How to sell on the PrestaShop Addons](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/content/25-how-to-sell-on-prestashop-addons).

Contributor modules need to pass a technical validation before being sold on the Marketplace.
