# List of hooks in PrestaShop 1.7

## Update notes

A couple of hooks were modified between 1.7.0.x and 1.7.1.x.

* `actionDeleteProductInCartAfter` has been divided into two hooks:
    * `actionObjectProductInCartDeleteBefore`.
    * `actionObjectProductInCartDeleteAfter`.
* `displayProductButtons` has been renamed into `displayProductAdditionalInfo`.<br>
  Don’t worry, we kept an alias :)

## Full list

{{% notice tip %}}
**Search tip:** Some hooks are generated dynamically, so their names are documented in a generic way.

For example, `actionAdminCustomersFormModifier` is documented as `action<AdminControllerClassName>FormModifier`, so you won't find it if you search for the exact name. When you see a controller name or action in the hook name and you can't find it, try searching for a part of the hook name, like `FormModifier`.
