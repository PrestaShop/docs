# Coding standards

Consistency is important, even more so when writing open-source code, since the code belongs to millions of eyeballs, and bug-fixing relies on these teeming millions to actually locate bugs and understand how to solve them.

This is why, when writing anything for PrestaShop, be it a theme, a module or a core patch, you should strive to follow the following guidelines. They are the ones that PrestaShop's developers adhere to, and following them is the surest way to have your code be elegantly integrated in PrestaShop.

In short, code consistency helps keeping the code readable and maintainable.

## General conventions

All files containing code MUST:

* Use only UTF-8 without BOM.
* Use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending.
* End with a single blank line.

## PHP code conventions

PHP files MUST follow the [PSR-2 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) alongside [Symfony standards](https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/contributing/code/standards.html#structure).

{{% notice note %}}
Although [Yoda conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions) are suggested, they are not enforced.
{{% /notice %}}

[PHP CS Fixer](https://cs.sensiolabs.org/) has been configured for the PrestaShop project to help developers to comply with these conventions.

You can run it using the following command:
```bash
php ./bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

The prestashop specific configuration file [can be found here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/.php_cs.dist)

And you can also use the provided [git pre-commit](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop/.github/contrib) sample in order to make sure you never forget to make your code compliant!

## Javascript code conventions

Javascript files MUST follow the [Airbnb Javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## HTML, CSS (Sass), Twig & Smarty code conventions

HTML, CSS (Sass), Twig and Smarty files MUST follow the [Mark Otto's coding standards](http://codeguide.co/).
Mark is the creator of the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/).
