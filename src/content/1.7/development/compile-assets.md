# How to compile assets

Some components in PrestaShop, like Javascript or SCSS files, need to be compiled to be usable.

## Requirements

We use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile assets. You only need NodeJS from 8.x to 12.x ([get it here](https://nodejs.org/)), NPM will take care of it all.

## Assets that need to be compiled

- Back Office
  - Default theme
    - SASS files\
      Located in `admin-dev/themes/default/sass`
  - New theme
    - SCSS files\
      Located in `admin-dev/themes/new-theme/scss`
    - JS files\
      Located in `admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js`
- Front Office
  - Core assets
    - JS files\
      Located in `themes/_core/js`
  - Classic theme
    - SCSS files\
      Located in `themes/classic/_dev/css`
    - JS files\
      Located in `themes/classic/_dev/js`

## Compiling assets

1. Switch to the root of the subproject

   | Subproject    | Path                             |
   | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | Default theme | `cd admin-dev/themes/default/`   |
   | New theme     | `cd admin-dev/themes/new-theme/` |
   | FO Core       | `cd themes/`                     |
   | Classic theme | `cd themes/classic/_dev/`        |

2) Run npm install (first time only)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3) Run webpack

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Build all assets at once

{{< minver v="1.7.6" title="true" >}}

You can rebuild all the assets at once by executing this command from the project root:

```bash
./tools/assets/build.sh
# or alternatively, since 1.7.8:
make assets
```

### Watching for changes

You can also make webpack listen for changes and compile only what's needed as you work on your files:

```bash
npm run watch
```

{{% notice warning %}}
**Rebuild your changes before committing.**

The "watch" build will optimize your assets for development. Please remember to rebuild for production when you are done using `npm run build`.
{{% /notice %}}

## Troubleshooting

If `npm install` fails with error: `Failed at the ... postinstall script.`:

You may be using an old version or one we don't support yet. Currently on 1.7.8, every folders containing a package.json is compatible with node 12.
How we manage to work with this, as well as working on previous PrestaShop version, is that we use a tool to easily swap between node version.

There are a lot of tools able to do this. At PrestaShop, we mainly use the ['n' package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n?activeTab=versions) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
This is pretty easy to use, when you are working on a directory which need an older or newer node version, use one of these tools to switch and then `npm install && npm run build`.

If you working with PrestaShop's production release for an actual shop instead of development, new-theme directory will not have a package.json, this means that the dependencies will be incorrect and the `npm run build` will display an error message like this:

```
Module build failed: Error: Couldn't find preset "env" relative to directory
```

You can solve this by changing to a release for development or by copy the necessary json file to your new-theme folder, navigate there and run `npm install`.
