Asset Management
================

PrestaShop 1.7 has significantly improved the way assets (CSS,
JavaScript and image files) are managed.

We advise theme developers to compile most of their style and JavaScript
code into a single concatenated/minified file (see the Webpack section
below).

If you need to add special assets, for example an extra JavaScript
library on the home page or the product page, there are a few ways to do
so.

Your theme have to print assets correctly in the smarty template, and
it's explained
in the template section &lt;../templates/05-head.rst&gt;.

Registering assets
------------------

In PrestaShop 1.7+, it's easy to register custom assets on each pages.
The major improvement is that you can easily manage them from your
theme, without any modules.

We introduced new methods to register assets, and especially new cool
options.

For instance, you can register your asset specifically in the head or
bottom of your HTML code; you can load it with attributes like `async`
or `defer`; and you can even inline it easily.

One favorite option is the priority one, which makes it very easy to
ensure everything is loaded in the order you need.

> **note**
>
> Backward compatibility is kept for the `addJS()`, `addCSS()`,
> `addJqueryUI()` and `addJqueryPlugin()` methods. Incidentally, now is
> the best time to update your libraries and use the new method.

Here is a list of options, and what they do.

### Options

PrestaShop's FrontController class provides 2 new methods to easily
register new assets: `registerStylesheet()` and `registerJavascript()`.

In order to have the most extensible signatures, these 2 methods take 3
arguments. The first one is the unique ID of the asset, the second one
is the relative path, and the third one is an array of all other
optional parameters, as described below.

**ID**

This unique identifier needed for each asset. This is useful to either
override or unregister something already loaded by the Core or a native
module.

**Relative path**

This is the path of your asset. In order to make your assets fully
overridable and compatible with the parent/child feature, you need to
provide the path from the theme's root directory, or PrestaShop's root
directory if it's a module.

For example:

-   'assets/css/example.css' for something in your theme.
-   'modules/modulename/css/example.cs' for something in your module.

### Registering in themes

By now you probably understood that this `theme.yml` file became the
heart of PrestaShop themes.

To register assets, create a new `assets` key at the top level of your
`theme.yml`, and register your files according to your needs. Page
identifiers are based on the `php_self` property of each controller
([example](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/b2ba1c2ecd627e23993c9356165e0d1e842a2faa/controllers/front/ProductController.php#L35))

For example, if you want to add an external library on each page and a
custom library on the Product page:

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
assets:
  css:
    product:
      - id: product-extra-style
        path: assets/css/product.css
        media: all
        priority: 100
  js:
    all:
      - id: this-cool-lib
        path: assets/js/external-lib.js
        priority: 30
        position: bottom
    product:
      - id: product-custom-lib
        path: assets/js/product.js
        priority: 200
        attribute: async
```

### Registering in modules

When developing a PrestaShop module, you may want to add specific styles
for your templates. The best way is to use the `registerStylesheet` and
`registerJavascript` methods provided by the parent `FrontController`
class.

> **note**
>
> If you're developing a custom module that only works on your themes,
> don't put any style or JavaScript code inside the module: put it in
> the theme's files instead (`theme.js` and `theme.css`).

#### With a front controller module

If you develop a front controller, simply extend the `setMedia()`
method. For instance:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
public function setMedia()
{
    parent::setMedia();

    if ('product' === $this->php_self) {
        $this->registerStylesheet(
            'module-modulename-style',
            'modules/'.$this->module->name.'/css/modulename.css',
            [
              'media' => 'all',
              'priority' => 200,
            ]
        );

        $this->registerJavascript(
            'module-modulename-simple-lib',
            'modules/'.$this->module->name.'/js/lib/simple-lib.js',
            [
              'priority' => 200,
              'attribute' => 'async',
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

#### Without a front controller module

If you only have your module's class, register your code on the
actionFrontControllerSetMedia hook, and add your asset on the go inside
the hook:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia($params)
{
    // Only on product page
    if ('product' === $this->context->controller->php_self) {
        $this->context->controller->registerStylesheet(
            'module-modulename-style',
            'modules/'.$this->name.'/css/modulename.css',
            [
              'media' => 'all',
              'priority' => 200,
            ]
        );

        $this->context->controller->registerJavascript(
            'module-modulename-simple-lib',
            'modules/'.$this->name.'/js/lib/simple-lib.js',
            [
              'priority' => 200,
              'attribute' => 'async',
            ]
        );
    }

    // On every pages
    $this->context->controller->registerJavascript(
        'google-analytics',
        'modules/'.$this->name.'/ga.js',
        [
          'position' => 'head',
          'inline' => true,
          'priority' => 10,
        ]
    );
}
```

### Unregistering

You can unregister assets! That's the whole point of an `id`. For
example if you want to improve your theme/module's compatibility with a
module, you can unregister its assets and handle them yourself.

Let's say you want to be fully compatible with a popular navigation
module. You could create a template override of course, but you could
also remove the style that comes with it and bundle your specific style
in your `theme.css` (since it's loaded on every page).

To unregister an assets, you need to know its ID.

#### In themes

As of today, the only way to unregister an asset without any module is
to place an empty file where the module override would be.

If the module registers a JavaScript file placed in `views/js/file.js`,
you simply need to create an empty file in
`modules/modulename/views/js/file.js`.

It works for both JavaScript and CSS assets.

#### In modules

Both `unregisterJavascript` and `unregisterStylesheet` methods take only
one argument: the unique ID of the resource you want to remove.

``` {.sourceCode .php}
// In a front controller
public function setMedia()
{
    parent::setMedia();

    $this->unregisterJavascript('the-identifier');
}

// In a module class
public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia($params)
{
  $this->context->controller->unregisterJavascript('the-identifier');
}
```
