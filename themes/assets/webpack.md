About Webpack
=============

> [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is a module bundler. Webpack
> takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets
> representing those modules.

The main interest of using Webpack is that it will compile all your
styles - which we advise you to write using
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - into a single CSS file. This way, your
theme will make only one HTTP request for this single file, and since
your browser will cache it for later re-use, it will even donwload this
file only once.

The same goes with your JavaScript code. Instead of loading jQuery along
with its community plugins, your own custom plugins and any extra code
you might need, Webpack compiles and minifies all this JavaScript code
into a single file, which will be loaded once - and cached.

> **note**
>
> Webpack is not at all required by PrestaShop, you are free to use your
> favorite tool! The documentation explains Webpack since it's the tool
> we chose for the Classic theme, and StarterTheme ships with a
> ready-to-use configuration file.

Installing webpack
------------------

If you want to compile your assets using Webpack (and we advise you to),
follow these steps:

1.  Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which contains
    the npm tool.
2.  In your command line tool, open the \_dev folder.
3.  Install npm: npm install.
4.  You then have a choice:

> -   To build your assets once, type npm run build.
> -   To rebuild your assets every time you change a file in the \_dev
>     folder, type npm run watch.

Webpack configuration
---------------------

The [Webpack configuration file for
StarterTheme](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme/blob/develop/_dev/webpack.config.js)
is thus:

1.  All CSS rules go to the assets/css/theme.css file.
2.  All JavaScript code go to the assets/js/theme.js file.

It provides proper configuration for compile your Sass, Less, Stylus or
CSS files into a single CSS file.

JavaScript code is written in ES6, and compiled to ES5 with Babel.

If you want to use Stylus or Less, simply edit the command line under
the "scripts" section.

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var webpack = require('webpack');
var ExtractTextPlugin = require("extract-text-webpack-plugin");

var plugins = [];

plugins.push(
  new ExtractTextPlugin('../css/theme.css')
);

module.exports = [{
  // JavaScript
  entry: [
    './js/theme.js'
  ],
  output: {
    path: '../assets/js',
    filename: 'theme.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      loaders: ['babel-loader']
    }]
  },
  externals: {
    prestashop: 'prestashop'
  },
  plugins: plugins,
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js']
  }
}, {
  // CSS
  entry: [
    './css/normalize.css',
    './css/example.less',
    './css/st/dev.styl',
    './css/theme.scss'
  ],
  output: {
    path: '../assets/js',
    filename: 'theme.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.scss$/,
      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(
        "style",
        "css-loader?sourceMap!postcss!sass-loader?sourceMap"
      )
    }, {
      test: /\.styl$/,
      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(
        "style",
        "css-loader?sourceMap!postcss!stylus-loader?sourceMap"
      )
    }, {
      test: /\.less$/,
      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(
        "style",
        "css-loader?sourceMap!postcss!less-loader?sourceMap"
      )
    }, {
      test: /\.css$/,
      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(
        'style',
        'css-loader?sourceMap!postcss-loader'
      )
    }, {
      test: /.(png|woff(2)?|eot|ttf|svg)(\?[a-z0-9=\.]+)?$/,
      loader: 'file-loader?name=../css/[hash].[ext]'
    }]
  },
  plugins: plugins,
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.scss', '.styl', '.less', '.css']
  }
}];
```
