Migrating from PrestaShop 1.6
================================

PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a totally reworked theme system from version 1.6, with the goal of making PrestaShop upgrades easier, and of making it easier/faster to create a brand new theme.

The huge change to the theme system means that there is no easy way to migrate your PrestaShop 1.6 theme to PrestaShop 1.7.

When using the automatic upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to 1.7, your theme will be switched to the new default theme, called "Classic". We therefore advise you to work on your 1.7 theme before you make the switch to PrestaShop 1.7.


Dropped features
--------------

Some features have been dropped with PrestaShop 1.7. They were either already deprecated in 1.6, or proved too problematic to maintain.

+---------+---------------------+
| Feature | Reasons             |
+---------+---------------------+
| Live Edit | Live Edit will be replaced by a brand new theme editor in the next PrestaShop version |
+---------+---------------------+
| Scenes | Scenes have were alreadt hidden for new installes of PS 1.6, and were unsupported. There are now removed in PrestaShop 1.7. |
+---------+---------------------+
| Mobile theme | In the last few years, webdesign have gone responsive. There is no need for a mobile-specific theme anymore: the way to go is responsive design. Note that modules can still be disabled on a device-type basis. |
+---------+---------------------+
| Map for store page | The default theme doesn't come with a map on the store page. |
+---------+---------------------+
| 5-step checkout | There is no more choice between 5-step checkout or one-page checkout (OPC). There is only one checkout, fully compatible with European laws. |
