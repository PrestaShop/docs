Coding standard and guidelines
==============================

General code guideline
----------------------

Intend with spaces for every language (PHP, HTML, CSS, etc.): 4 spaces
for PHP files, 2 spaces for all other filetypes.

Use our [.editorconfig file](http://editorconfig.org/) in order to
easily configure your editor:

PHP files
---------

You should follow the [PSR-2
standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), just like PrestaShop does.

In general, we tend to follow [Symfony's coding
standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).

HTML file
---------

Use HTML 5 tags:

-   &lt;br /&gt; --&gt; &lt;br&gt;,
-   &lt;nav&gt;,
-   &lt;section&gt;,
-   etc.

All open tags must be closed in the same file (a &lt;div&gt; should
**not** be opened in `header.tpl` then closed in `footer.tpl`).
Subtemplates (templates meant to be included in another template) must
reside inside a `/_partials/` folder.

CSS
---

Use CSS3.

We recommend that you follow the RSCSS structure: <http://rscss.io/>

JavaScript
----------

Make sure your linter tool follows our .eslint file:
<https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/.eslintrc>

If you wish to write ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) code, we advise you to use
the Babel compiler: <https://babeljs.io/>

A good JS practice consists in splitting files per use, and then
compiling them into one.

Learn more about the ES2015 standard:
<https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/>
