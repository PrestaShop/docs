Migrating from PrestaShop 1.6
=============================

PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a totally reworked theme system from version
1.6, with the goal of making PrestaShop upgrades easier, and of making
it easier/faster to create a brand new theme.

The huge change to the theme system means that there is no easy way to
migrate your PrestaShop 1.6 theme to PrestaShop 1.7.

When using the automatic upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to 1.7, your theme
will be switched to the new default theme, called "Classic". We
therefore advise you to work on your 1.7 theme before you make the
switch to PrestaShop 1.7.

Dropped features --------------

Some features have been dropped with PrestaShop 1.7. They were either
already deprecated in 1.6, or proved too problematic to maintain.

  ---------- ----------------------
  Feature    Reasons

  Live Edit  Live Edit will be
             replaced by a brand
             new theme editor in
             the next PrestaShop
             version

  Scenes |   Scenes have were
             alreadt hidden for new
             installes of PS 1.6,
             and were unsupported.
             There are now removed
             in PrestaShop 1.7.

  Mobile th  eme | In the last few
             years, webdesign have
             gone responsive. There
             is no need for a
             mobile-specific theme
             anymore: the way to go
             is responsive design.
             Note that modules can
             still be disabled on a
             device-type basis.

  Map for s  tore page | The
             default theme doesn't
             come with a map on the
             store page.

  5-step ch  eckout | There is no
             more choice between
             5-step checkout or
             one-page checkout
             (OPC). There is only
             one checkout, fully
             compatible with
             European laws.
