Prologue
========

The default PrestaShop install offers a neutral theme in black and
white, enabling sellers to quickly and freely start their activity,
whatever their business line.

Nearly 2000 themes are available through the PrestaShop Addons
marketplace (<http://addons.prestashop.com/en/>). They were created
either by members of the PrestaShop community or the PrestaTeam, and are
sold at reasonable prices â€“ some are even free.

As a graphic designer/web developer, you too can put your themes up for
sale on the PrestaShop Addons site, and earn 70% of the selling price.
