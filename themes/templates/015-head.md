Head
====

The head part is very important in term of SEO and performences.

Have look at StarterTheme and Classic head part to see real life
examples.

Assets
------

PrestaShop 1.7 changed the way asset works and it means the way to it's
added inside the `<head>` tag of your page changed a bit too.

There are 2 importants files to use:

-   `_partials/stylesheets.tpl`
-   `_partials/javascript.tpl`

There 2 files are used to take full advantage of the new features of
1.7, like async loading for javascript or automatic inline for CSS.

If you're using StarterTheme (which I believe you do) there is nothing
to do, it works out of the box.

> **warning**
>
> The `_partials/javascript.tpl` has to be included at the bottom of
> your page as well.

``` {.sourceCode .smarty+html}
{block name='stylesheets'}
  {include file="_partials/stylesheets.tpl" stylesheets=$stylesheets}
{/block}

{block name='javascript_head'}
  {include file="_partials/javascript.tpl" javascript=$javascript.head vars=$js_custom_vars}
{/block}
```

Those 2 subtemplates are very simple, they loop and print each provided
assets.

SEO
---

A lot of meta and SEO information belong here, there is a special block
for it so template which extend this layout can easily redefine the page
title or description.

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
{block name='head_seo'}

  <title>{block name='head_seo_title'}{$page.meta.title}{/block}</title>
  <meta name="description" content="{block name='head_seo_description'}{$page.meta.description}{/block}">
  <meta name="keywords" content="{block name='head_seo_keywords'}{$page.meta.keywords}{/block}">

  {if $page.meta.robots !== 'index'}
    <meta name="robots" content="{$page.meta.robots}">
  {/if}

  {if $page.canonical}
    <link rel="canonical" href="{$page.canonical}">
  {/if}

{/block}
```
