Templates & layouts
===================

PrestaShop template file are based on the [Smarty 3 template
engine](http://www.smarty.net/v3_overview).

All template files must be stored in the theme's `templates/` subfolder.
For instance, the default theme has its template files in the following
folder: `/themes/classic/templates`.

Directory structure
-------------------

Templates are then split between various subfolders.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Folder       Description
  ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------
  \_partials   Code shared accross the whole site like header, footer or
               notifications.

  catalog      Product page, product/brand/supplier listing, search result
               and such.

  checkout     Cart, delivery options, payement options, order
               confirmations and such.

  cms          All the static content: contact, sitemap, CMS pages and
               such.

  customer     Everything about the customer's account and its data.

  errors       All the error templates: not found, server error, forbidden
               and such.

  layouts      The theme layouts: 1, 2 or more columns, full width,
               everything is possible.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Template files should be written so that a single .tpl can generate a
whole HTML page -- unless they are inside a `_partials` folder or
subfolder (see our coding standard, linked from the Prologue chapter of
this documentation).

Templates
---------

We make a **clear difference between templates and layout**.

-   A template extends a layout.
-   The layout hold the global organization of the page
-   A template a specify to a feature: the product page for example

There are many templates is a PrestaShop theme, the main ones includes:

-   **index.tpl** for the home page
-   **catalog/product.tpl** for the product page
-   **catalog/listing/product-list.tpl** for any product list page
-   **checkout/cart.tpl** for the detailed cart
-   **checkout/checkout.tpl** for the checkout process

### Specific templates

If you're working on a big store in many languages you may need to
change the layout of the page depending on the language.

For example you want a different product page for american customers and
japanese ones. In this case you simply have to create new template
`product.tpl` and place it in the right folder.

When searching for a template, PrestaShop will check many location to
determine which file should be used. It make it very easy to have
different template for a given locale or a specific entity id.

With the product page, the core will check the following locations (in
order) and return the first template found:

Example with a product with ID = 3 and locale = en-US

1.  `en-US/catalog/product-3.tpl`
2.  `catalog/product-3.tpl`
3.  `en/US/catalog/listing/product.tpl`
4.  `catalog/listing/product.tpl`

Another example with category template for the category with ID = 9 and
locale = en-US.

1.  `en-US/catalog/listing/category-9.tpl`
2.  `catalog/listing/category-9.tpl`
3.  `en/US/catalog/listing/category.tpl`
4.  `catalog/listing/category.tpl`
5.  `en-US/catalog/listing/product-list.tpl`
6.  `catalog/listing/product-list.tpl`

This feature is mostly made for developer working on a custom template
for a customer.

Layouts
-------

The layout is the organisation of the page, the way in which the parts
of your design are arranged. The typical example is the sidebar: is
there a sidebar on your category page or is your product listing is
taking the whole space.

With PrestaShop 1.7, user are given the ability to change the lyaout of
each page independantly. As a template developer, it's your role to
ensure your theme is compatible.

### What's in a layout file

The layout is the very top level of the
template inheritance &lt;../smarty/template-inheritance.rst&gt;\_ tree.
Basically it hold the opening and closing `<html>` tags.

Typical layout files look like the following snippet. This one is a full
one

> **note**
>
> Remember to define as many blocks as possible.

``` {.sourceCode .smarty+html}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="{$language.iso_code}">

<head>
  {block name='head'}
    {include file='_partials/head.tpl'}
  {/block}
</head>

<body id="{$page.page_name}" class="{$page.body_classes|classnames}">

  {hook h='displayAfterBodyOpeningTag'}

  <main>

    <header id="header">
      {block name='header'}
        {include file='_partials/header.tpl'}
      {/block}
    </header>

    <section id="wrapper">
      <div class="container">

        {block name='breadcrumb'}
          {include file='_partials/breadcrumb.tpl'}
        {/block}

        {block name="left_column"}
          <div id="left-column">
            {if $page.page_name == 'product'}
              {hook h='displayLeftColumnProduct'}
            {else}
              {hook h="displayLeftColumn"}
            {/if}
          </div>
        {/block}

        {block name="content_wrapper"}
          <div id="content-wrapper">
            {block name="content"}
              <p>Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>
            {/block}
          </div>
        {/block}

      </div>
    </section>

    <footer id="footer">
      {block name="footer"}
        {include file="_partials/footer.tpl"}
      {/block}
    </footer>

  </main>

  {hook h='displayBeforeBodyClosingTag'}

  {block name='javascript_bottom'}
    {include file="_partials/javascript.tpl" javascript=$javascript.bottom}
  {/block}

</body>

</html>
```

From there, each part of the theme will do its job and replace content
inside these briks, keeping the same organization.
