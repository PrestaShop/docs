Notifications
=============

Throughout the whole front office, the customer can receive notification
messages from PrestaShop, to inform her about successes or errors for
instance. Your theme can too send notifications when certain events
occur.

The notification messages are not hardcoded in the template files, but
are sent from the controller, so that you have consistency in case you
update/change your theme. Also, this way there is a better chance that
all notification messages are already translated into your language!

Types of notifications
----------------------

An array of notification is passed to the templates, containing at least
one of these:

  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  success      An action was performed and everything went well.
  error        Something went wrong.
  warning      Important notice the merchant should know about.
  info         "just so you know".
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------

How to display notifications
----------------------------

In the Starter Theme, [notifications are implemented as a partial
template
file](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme/blob/master/templates/_partials/notifications.tpl):

``` {.sourceCode .smarty}
<aside id="notifications">
  <div class="container">
    {if $notifications.error}
      <article class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        <ul>
          {foreach $notifications.error as $notif}
            <li>{$notif}</li>
          {/foreach}
        </ul>
      </article>
    {/if}

    {if $notifications.warning}
      <article class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <ul>
          {foreach $notifications.warning as $notif}
            <li>{$notif}</li>
          {/foreach}
        </ul>
      </article>
    {/if}

    {if $notifications.success}
      <article class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        <ul>
          {foreach $notifications.success as $notif}
            <li>{$notif}</li>
          {/foreach}
        </ul>
      </article>
    {/if}

    {if $notifications.info}
      <article class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <ul>
          {foreach $notifications.info as $notif}
            <li>{$notif}</li>
          {/foreach}
        </ul>
      </article>
    {/if}
  </div>
</aside>
```

...and are then [included in the template
file](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme/blob/master/templates/checkout/checkout.tpl#L18-L20):

``` {.sourceCode .smarty}
{block name='notifications'}
  {include file='_partials/notifications.tpl'}
{/block}
```

Add your own message in your front controller
---------------------------------------------

Your front controller holds [the 4 following
variables](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/classes/controller/FrontController.php#L618-L640):

-   `$this->error`
-   `$this->success`
-   `$this->warning`
-   `$this->danger`

They are PHP arrays, and they hold messages as a string.

Since PrestaShop 1.7, you can [redirect the customer AND display a
message after an
action](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/classes/controller/FrontController.php#L553-L572).

``` {.sourceCode .php}
$this->success[] = $this->l('Information successfully updated.');
$this->redirectWithNotifications($this->getCurrentURL());
```
