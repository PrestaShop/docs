Helpers: functions and modifier
===============================

{url}
-----

PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new Smarty helper to generate URLs. This
will take care of SSL, domain name, virtual and physical base URI,
parameters concatenation, and of course URL rewritting.

`{url}` uses the Link class internally.

> **note**

> Please see the `$urls` dataset to find already regenerated urls (such
> as home, cart, login and so on).

> **warning**

> An instance of the Link object is still passed to the templates for
> backward compatibility purposes, since it was heavily used. **It is
> strongly recommended not to use it**.

Here is a few examples:

``` {.sourceCode .smarty}
{url entity=address id=$id_address}
{url entity=address params=['id_address' => $id_address]}
{url entity=address id=$id_address params=['delete' => 1]}
```

...will respectively output:

``` {.sourceCode .html}
http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3
http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3
http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3&delete=1
```

Widgets
-------

### {widget}

PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new way to display modules in a theme.
Instead of using a hook and hooking your module to it, the widget's
function lets you display any content from the module in your template.

This is a key feature of PrestaShop 1.7, make sure you
read the dedicated documentation &lt;../modules/widget&gt;.

Here is an example from classic theme, it displays the shop contact
details wherever you want.

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
<div id="sidebar">
  {widget name="ps_contactinfo"}
</div>
```

Since the module may have a different behavior depending on which hook
they are hooked on, you can pass the hook name.

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
<div id="footer">
  {widget name="ps_contactinfo" hook="displayFooter"}
</div>
```

### {widget\_block}

Even better, you can rewrite the template on the go. The module will use
your Smarty code instead of loading the template file.

Taking the [ps\_linklist
module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_linklist/tree/master) as an
example. Instead of using
`ps_linklist/views/templates/hook/linkblock.tpl`, you can override it
this way:

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
{widget_block name="ps_linklist"}
  {foreach $linkBlocks as $linkBlock}
    <ul>
      {foreach $linkBlock.links as $link}
        <li>
            <h4><a href="{$link.url}">{$link.title}</a></h4>
            <p>{$link.description}</p>
        </li>
      {/foreach}
    </ul>
  {/foreach}
{/widget_block}
```

{render}
--------

Some elements coming from the controller might need to be passed to this
function. So far, it is only used for forms (customer information and
checkout).

``` {.sourceCode .smarty}
{render file='customer/_partials/login-form.tpl' ui=$login_form}
```

{form\_field}
-------------

`{form_field}` function will help you building forms, it can be compared
to the backoffice helpers introduced in PrestaShop 1.5. It helps you
keeping the form markup very consistent.

As a template designer you will find the markup of each elements in
`_partials/form-fields.tpl`.

``` {.sourceCode .smarty}
{form_field field=$field}
```

...where `$field` is an array, like this example:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
$field = [
  'name' => 'user_email',
  'type' => 'email',
  'required' => 1,
  'label' => 'Email',
  'value' => null,
  'availableValues' => [],
  'errors' => [],
];
```

Class name modifiers
--------------------

In order to use the data from controller to generate classnames, we
added 2 modifiers: 'classname' and 'classnames'.

### `classname`

The classname data modifier will ensure that your string is a valid
class name.

It will:

1.  Put it in lowercase.
2.  Replace any non-ASCII characters (such as accented characters) with
    their ASCII equivalent. [See the code
    here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/classes/Tools.php#L1252-L1354).
3.  Replace all non-alphanumerical characters with a single dash.
4.  Ensure only one consecutive dash is used.

``` {.sourceCode .smarty}
{assign var=attr value='Hérè-Is_a-Clàssnåme--@#$$ˆ*(&-----'}
{$attr|classname}
```

...will output:

``` {.sourceCode .text}
here-is-a-classname-v
```

### `classnames`

This data modifier takes an array, where the key is the classname and
the value is a boolean indicating if it should be outputted or not.

Note that each class name is passed through the `classname` modifier.

``` {.sourceCode .php}
$body_classes = [
  "lang-fr" => true,
  "rtl" => false,
  "country-FR" => true,
  "currency-EUR" => true,
  "layout-full-width" => true,
  "page-index" => true,
];
```

This way, this Smarty code:

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
<body class="{$page.body_classes|classnames}">
```

...will generate:

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
<body class="lang-fr country-fr currency-eur layout-full-width page-index">
```
