Template inheritance
====================

PrestaShop 1.7 relies a lot on template inheritance in order to create
the most consistant theme possible while heavily reducing the amount of
duplicated code.

The principle
-------------

Template inheritance allow you to extend a parent template and only
redefine the block you need.

The picture below illustrates the example of a specific product page
extending a generic one. Say you have three files: `layout-pack.tpl`
extending `product.tpl`, himself extending `page.tpl`.

The `product-page.tpl` file will **only** contain the product
description part. Everything else will be exactly the same as product
page. Even better, the product page will only define the main content of
the page, everything else will be taken from its own parent template (ie
page.tpl).

The wrong way of doing this would be to extract header, footer and
reusable part of the template and \_include\_ them in each file.

The [official Smarty documentation](http://www.smarty.net/inheritance)
has a nice and simple example. In their own words:

> "Template inheritance is an approach to managing templates that
> resembles object-oriented programming techniques. Instead of the
> traditional use of {include ...} tags to manage parts of templates,
> you can inherit the contents of one template to another (like
> extending a class) and change blocks of content therein (like
> overriding methods of a class.) This keeps template management minimal
> and efficient, since each template only contains the differences from
> the template it extends."

PrestaShop real life example
----------------------------

In a PrestaShop theme, many pages are very similar, for example template
listing products: categories, new products, search results, and so on.
All of them display a list of product so in PS 1.7 they all extend
`catalog/listing/product-list.tpl` (which extends the main layout).

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
{extends file=$layout}

{block name='content'}
  <section id="main">

    {block name='product_list_header'}
      <h2 class="h2">{$listing.label}</h2>
    {/block}

    {block name='product_list'}
      {include file='catalog/_partials/products.tpl' listing=$listing}
    {/block}

  </section>
{/block}
```

The template will show a title and a list of product underneath. For
category page, we want a nice description with an cover image. So we can
simply override the *product\_list\_header*

``` {.sourceCode .html+smarty}
{extends file='catalog/listing/product-list.tpl'}

{block name='product_list_header'}

  <h1>{$category.name}</h1>
  <div class="category-cover">
    <img src="{$category.image.large.url}" alt="{$category.image.legend}">
  </div>
  <div id="category-description">{$category.description nofilter}</div>

{/block}
```

This reduce code to the minimum, without any repetition.
