FO Hooks
========

This section of the documentation is only about front office hooks:
display and action.

All Hooks
---------

// TODO create page with table listing the content of the hooks.json
file.

Creating a custom hook --------------------

### Creating a dynamic hook

When your module or theme calls a hook, PrestaShop executes it.

From a regular PHP file:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
Hook::exec('MyCustomHook');
```

From a Smarty template:

``` {.sourceCode .Smarty}
{hook h='MyCustomHook'}
```

### Making your hook visible and reusable

If you want the user to be able to see your hook in PrestaShop's
Position page (in the back office), it has to be registered.

You can register your hook from your theme's theme.yml file:

\[SEE\] theme-yml

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
global_settings:
  hooks:
    custom_hooks:
      - name: displayFooterBefore
        title: displayFooterBefore
        description: Add a widget area above the footer
```

You can also register your hook from a module:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
```

> // Create the function for the MyCustomHook hook public function
> MyCustomHook(\$params) { // method body }
>
> // Register the MyCustomHook hook Hook::register('MyCustomHook');
>
> // Call it from PHP Hook::exec('MyCustomHook');
