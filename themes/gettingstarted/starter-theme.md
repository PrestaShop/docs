Starter Theme
=============

PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new way for designers to create their theme
from scratch: the Starter Theme. The default theme for PS 1.7 is based
on the Starter Theme.

For pretty much every CMS, the default theme is used as a framework to
build custom theme: designers have to rework the default theme and
reshape it into what they want to display. Sometimes that means having
to spend a lot of time removing all the CSS rules and JavaScript code
from the default theme, and rewriting everything. This means a LOT of
work before even starting to actually create something original.

This means that a lot of themes are tied to the default theme's
technical choices, because this way of working makes it hard to make
your own choices. For instance, since the default theme uses Bootstrap,
it's hard to use Foundation.

With the Starter Theme, the PrestaShop team decided to build a skeleton
theme that will give you a kickstart for your custom theme, with all the
minimum code (essential template files, markup and JavaScript code) and
enough freedom to make your own choices. You can choose to use
Bootstrap, Foundation or Blueprint. The Starter Theme is not
opinionated: there is no decision made to use either one library or
another.

By using the Starter Theme as the foundation for your custom theme,
everything is ready for you, you *just* have to create upon it.

Downloading the Starter Theme
-----------------------------

The Starter Theme is available on GitHub:
<https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme>

If you download the StarterTheme and select it as the theme for your
store, you will see minimalistic theme with an overly simplistic (ugly?)
style. This is only for development purpose. You should NOT use the
Starter Theme as is, and you should NOT use its default CSS rules nor
include them in your theme: please delete all files inside \_dev/css.

> **note**

> The jQuery v2 library is loaded by the core.js file.

> **warning**

> Please note that if you want to sell your theme on the PrestaShop
> Addons marketplace, there are some specific requirements. For
> instance, Addons-distributed themes MUST use Bootstrap 4.

Modify. Don't override.
-----------------------

When you want to create a new theme, copy and paste all files from the
Starter Theme inside your empty theme directory. Then you start
modifying it, and building your own theme.

Do not use it as a parent theme, you will only run into trouble and
waste your time.

Once you removed all style in `_dev/css`, your theme should like this:
