Theme organization
==================

Directory structure
-------------------

A PrestaShop theme is a set of files which you can edit in order to
change the look of your online shop.

Here are a few important tidbits:

-   All themes have their files located in the /themes folder, at the
    root of PrestaShop's folder.
-   Each theme has its own sub-folder, in the main themes folder.
-   Each theme is made of template files (.tpl), image files (.jpg, .png
    and such), one or more CSS files (.css), and usually JavaScript
    files (.js).
-   Each theme has a preview.png image file in its folder, enabling the
    shop-owner to see what the theme looks like directly from the back
    office, and select the theme appropriately.

The best way to learn how to create a theme for PrestaShop 1.7 is to
dive into the StarterTheme.

Here is its organization, which is explained further below.

```

The folders are used this way:

  Folder      Purpose
  ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \_dev       Contains the raw development files for your SCSS, JavaScript and image assets.
              They are to be compiled using Webpack, and turned into production assets.
  assets      Contains the production assets, compiled by Webpack from the \_dev files.
  config      Contains configuration file. By default, it only has the theme.yml file.
  module      Contains either theme-specific modules, or the theme's version of native modules' template
              files. For instance, the
              `themes/classic/modules/ps_categorytree/views/templates/front/ps_categorytree.tpl` file
              replaces the Category module's own `modules/ps_categorytree/views/templates/front/ps_categorytree.tpl`
  plugins     Your custom smarty plugins
  templates   Contains the template files themselves (.tpl), mostly in contextual subfolders (catalog,
              checkout, cms, etc.). The \_partials folder contains "partial templates", which means parts
              that can used by / included into several templates: header.tpl, breadcrumb.tpl, footer.tpl, etc.
              This prevents redundant code blocks, and makes themes easier to maintain.

Required templates and libraries
--------------------------------

### Required templates

When you install/enable a theme, PrestaShop checks if the theme is
valid: it looks for the theme.yml file (and checks its content), its
declared compatibility, and the existence of some files.

There is a list of files that need to exists, even if they're empty.
Please see dedicated documentation to know
what makes a theme valid &lt;../distribution/testing&gt;.

It could be that you've built some sort of groundbreaking theme and it
doesn't exactly work like the Starter Theme does. For instance, if you
don't have a product page, then you don't need the product.tpl file. In
that case, you just have to create an empty product.tpl file. Be nice to
the next developer and add a comment indicating where the code related
to products can be found ;)

### Required libraries

jQuery v2.1 is loaded by the core (bundled in `core.js`) file, but no
other libraries, since the idea is that the Starter Theme should not be
opinionated.
