Setting up your local environment
=================================

Now that you intend to building a theme for PrestaShop, you are better
off keeping all your development work on your machine. The main
advantage is that it makes it possible for you to entirely bypass the
process of uploading your files on your online server in order to test
your changes. Another advantage is that a local test environment enables
you to test code without the risk of breaking your production store.
Having a local environment is the essential first step in the path of
web development.

Installing PrestaShop
---------------------

We advise you to install PrestaShop using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Then, open a command line on your (empty) working directory, then:

1.  `git clone https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop.git`
2.  `composer install`

Using git you can choose your PrestaShop version:
`git checkout 1.7.0.0`. Also we would warn you to test your final result
with a zip release, just for safety (since vendor version might be
slightly different).

Building your .gitignore file
-----------------------------

A gitignore file is a must-have for any Git-versioned project, as it
specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

### What to ignore

Generally, you shouldnâ€™t version the following types of files:

-   Temporary files (such as cache files)
-   Generated files (such as minified CSS or retrieved XML files)
-   Files with credentials or personal information (such as
    `settings.inc.php`)
-   OS and IDE-related files (such as .DS\_Store or .idea/)

``` {.sourceCode .text}
assets/css/*
assets/js/*
node_modules/
```

We suggest that you build your own using <http://gitignore.io>.

Create your theme from the Starter Theme
----------------------------------------

When you want to create a theme, the best way is to use the StarterTheme
as a base theme.

Create a new folder under `themes/` then download the StarterTheme and
copy its files in your new folder.

[Download StarterTheme](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme.git)

### Create your theme.yml file

First of all, you need to rename `config/theme.dist.yml` to
`config/theme.yml` and edit it according to your theme's name.

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
name: YOUR_THEME_DIRECTORY_NAME
display_name: YOUR THEME NAME
version: 1.0.0
author:
  name: "PrestaShop Team"
  email: "pub@prestashop.com"
  url: "http://www.prestashop.com"

meta:
  compatibility:
      from: 1.7.0.0
      to: ~
```

Once it' done you'll be able to select your theme in your backoffice.
