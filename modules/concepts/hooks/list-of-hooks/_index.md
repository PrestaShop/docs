# List of hooks

{{% notice tip %}}
**Search tip:** Some hooks are generated dynamically, so their names are documented in a generic way.

For example, `actionAdminCustomersFormModifier` is documented as `action<AdminControllerClassName>FormModifier`, so you won't find it if you search for the exact name. When you see a controller name or action in the hook name and you can't find it, try searching for a part of the hook name, like `FormModifier`.
