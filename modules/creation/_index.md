# Getting Started

If you want to get started quickly with a ready-to-use module template, you can use [PrestaShop Validator's Module Generator](https://validator.prestashop.com/generator). It provides an easy way to generate a module, including the basic structure, customized default properties, and most common use cases covered (hook, upgrade...).

Other skeletons have been created to help you create specific modules:

* [Skeleton of a Payment module for PrestaShop 1.7](https://github.com/PrestaShop/paymentexample)
* [Skeleton of a module using CQRS feature](https://github.com/friends-of-presta/demo-cqrs-hooks-usage-module) ([More details about CQRS]({{< ref "8/development/architecture/domain/_index.md" >}}))
